I was tasked to complete four different legacy programming assignments that involved enchancement, reengineering and translating into other coding languages.

The first assignment involved reengineering a legacy Fortran program into a new contemporary version of Fortran. 
The second assignment I was tasked to write a program in Ada to perform some image processing operations on a grayscale image stored in an ASCII P2 PGM format.
The third assignment involved creating a modern Cobol program to perform ISBN validation of a series of 10-digit ISBNs stored in a user-inputed file.
In the last assignment, I translated the Algol-60 procedure to Fortran, Ada, C, and Python to calculate e to Many digits.
